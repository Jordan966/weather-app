My goal is a create a weather app that will display weather information to a specified area.

My initial thoughts going into this project are:

How do i get the live weather information?
How do i then display the information from the source of weather information?
Is this amitious given my little experience?
What do I need to learn in order to complete this project?
This project was a rated for beginners so I should be fine.

TASK 1: How do i get the live weather information?
Through research I found that I will need to use a Weather API.
weatherstack.com seemed to be straight forward and offered a free plan which allows me 1000/calls a day free.

TASK 2: How do i then display the information from the source of weather information?

1. Create boilerplate HTML, CSS & JS file.
